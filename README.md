You may have seen this game if you already tried to use Google Chrome browser without internet connection. This Dino Game was the proposal for one of the courses presented in the **HTML Web Developer** bootcamp. Concepts about **CSS and Javascript** are covered in the course and emphasize the Game Development with Javascript.
